# Welcome to my blog
## I am practicing write a blog on github.
**This is a course about *the basic writing* and *formatting syntax***

~~Maybe you are a fool who cannot understand this.~~

**But I will forgive you for that,_haha_**

**I used to say that:**

>I am marvelous.

**I think if you want to learn this,**

  **you can use 'like you' to ask me to teach you about it.**
  
  **or you can use**
  
  ```
  -LIKE YOU
  -LOVE YOU
  -MISS YOU
  ```
  
**when you have finished them as follows:**

- [x] LIKE ME
- [x] LOVE ME
- [x] MISS ME

**Then I will be very glad to tell you that you just need to learn it using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).**

**HAHA**

**This is soooo interesting!**:relaxed: :kissing_closed_eyes: :dancer:

**How time flies!**

**I have to say goodbye now.**

**Let's sing** \*Twinckle twinckle little star\* **together.** :star: :star2: :sparkles:

**OK, I miss you!**

**You are so great! (Just like me.)**

**Don't you think so? @Tan Gouxing**
